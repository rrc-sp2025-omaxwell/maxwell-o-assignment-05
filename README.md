 - Unit Testing

## Reflection

### 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.

- Struggled trying to keep track of all the specific tests and their requirements, especially when going back to the functions to make corrections frequently needing to adjust one after the other.


### 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.

- Allows developers to test for different scenarios from small data type mismatches to rarer edge case scenarios, all to ensure the functions operate as expected.

- Challenges include keeping track of what types of tests exist, what types don't exist yet, and what tracking the specific variables referenced inside the functions. Making alterations to base functions during the testing phase can easily complicate the process if not properly taken care of.
